Dogecoin Node Setup Guide 🚀

A step-by-step guide to setting up a Dogecoin node, even if you're a Linux beginner.
📌 Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you:
✅ Have a stable internet connection
✅ Have access to your router settings (needed for port forwarding)
✅ Have a Linux machine (or Raspberry Pi) ready to install Dogecoin
📡 Configuring Router (Port Forwarding & Static IP)

To allow your node to connect properly, follow these steps:
Step 1: Log into your router

    Open a web browser and go to:

    192.168.0.1

    Log in (default password is usually on the router label).

Step 2: Assign a Static IP

    Go to DHCP Settings.
    Find your machine in the list of connected devices.
    Assign it a static IP, e.g.:

    192.168.0.24

    Remember this IP, you'll need it later.

Step 3: Open Port 22556

    Go to Port Forwarding settings.
    Create a new rule:
        Internal IP: (Your static IP from Step 2)
        Port: 22556 (start & end)
        Protocol: Both (TCP & UDP)
        Enable the rule

✅ Done! Your router is now configured.
🐶 Dogecoin Node Installation
Step 1: Download Dogecoin Core

Go to the official GitHub repository:
📥 Dogecoin Core v1.14.9

Download the appropriate file:

    PC/Linux → x86_64 binaries
    Raspberry Pi → arm-linux binaries

Step 2: Install Dogecoin Core

    Open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T).
    Extract the downloaded file:

tar xvf dogecoin-1.14.9-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz

Change directory:

cd dogecoin-1.14.9/bin/

Start Dogecoin Core (let it run for 60 sec):

./dogecoind

Stop the process:

Ctrl + C

Move Dogecoin binaries to a system-wide location:

    sudo cp dogecoin* /usr/bin/

✅ Dogecoin Core is installed!
⚙️ Configuring Dogecoin Node
Step 1: Create the Dogecoin Configuration File

    Go to the Dogecoin data directory:

cd ~/.dogecoin/

Open the config file in nano:

nano dogecoin.conf

Copy & paste the following configuration (modify username/password/IP):

    rpcuser=your_username
    rpcpassword=your_password
    rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
    maxconnections=50
    rpcport=22555
    server=1

    Save the file (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).

✅ Configuration is set up!
🚀 Starting the Dogecoin Node
Step 1: Create a Start Script

    Open a new file:

nano start.sh

Copy & paste the following:

dogecoind -conf=/home/your_username/.dogecoin/dogecoin.conf -daemon

(Replace your_username with your Linux username.)

Save the file (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).

Make the script executable:

chmod +x start.sh

Run the script:

    ./start.sh

✅ Your node is now running! 🎉
🔍 Checking Node Status

Run the following commands to check your node:

    Check block sync progress:

dogecoin-cli getblockcount

Check active connections:

    dogecoin-cli getconnectioncount

    If connections = 8, your port forwarding is incorrect!

✅ Your node is fully operational! 🎯
🎯 Summary
